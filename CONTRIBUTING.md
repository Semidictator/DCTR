# Contributing to DCTR

Thanks for your interest in contributing to DCTR. This project is a satirical SocialFi simulator on Solana, and we welcome contributions from developers, designers, and community members.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Smart contracts** (Anchor/Rust) — NFT Trophy minting, burn mechanisms, on-chain state tracking
- **Frontend/Website** — React/Next.js, leaderboard UI, wallet integration
- **Bots** — Telegram/Discord bots for the Cabinet system, Founder's Mandatory Speech Bot, etc.
- **Documentation** — improving clarity of the Whitepaper, tokenomics docs, or this repository
- **Bug reports** — see SECURITY.md for security-specific vulnerabilities; use GitHub Issues for everything else

## Before You Start

1. Check open Issues to see if someone is already working on what you have in mind.
2. For larger features, open an Issue first to discuss the approach before writing code — this avoids wasted effort if the direction needs to change.
3. Make sure your local environment matches the stack described in the System Architecture & Technical Specification document (Node.js 18+, Rust, Anchor 0.29.0, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7).

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch with a clear name (e.g. `fix/streak-detection-bug`, `feature/nft-burn-mint`).
3. Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.
4. If you touched smart contract code, include or update Anchor tests.
5. Open a Pull Request describing:
   - What the change does
   - Why it's needed
   - How you tested it
6. Be responsive to review feedback — we may ask for changes before merging.

## Code Style

- **Rust/Anchor:** follow standard Rust formatting (`cargo fmt`) and run `cargo clippy` before submitting.
- **TypeScript/React:** follow the existing project formatting; use Prettier if configured.
- **SQL:** use standard PostgreSQL syntax (no MySQL-specific syntax); always create indexes as separate `CREATE INDEX` statements.

## Reporting Security Issues

Do NOT open a public Issue for security vulnerabilities. See SECURITY.md for the private disclosure process.

## Code of Conduct

Keep discussion respectful and on-topic, even given the project's satirical tone. Satire targets the systems and mechanics being parodied — not other contributors, users, or community members.

## Questions

If anything here is unclear, reach out via X: @drjnab, or open a GitHub Discussion (if enabled) before starting significant work.
